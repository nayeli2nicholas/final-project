    Butter's Bakery is a family owned bakery based in the valley of California! These recipes
    were specially hand crafted and curated with love and years of handed down recipes [and lots of biscuit kneading from head chef, Butters] 
    that come fresh from our kitchen to yours! All of our recipes are vegetarian or vegan with some gluten-free options as well.

<h3> Who is Butter? </h3>

<div>
<p class="first"> 
    Butter was the first adopted senior rescue into the Nicholas family. She was rescued from abusive owners and spent months
    in a shelter where nobody paid her any mind because she was "too old." But, that didn't stop her from finding her family. In the Nicholas
    home she would spend many days and nights alongside her human, watching all of the sweet treat action take place.

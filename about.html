<h1> Our Story </h1>

Our story starts back in the very first home Butter and her mother conquered at the very start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sharing a kitchen
 with three strangers, Mrs. Nicholas and Butter began their baking journey. While she began whisking away and rolling dough, Butter stuck 
 to her side through the seemingly long hours. Day after day of being in what seemed like a never-ending spiral of a disastrous pandemic, they 
 spent most of their days baking away. Moving from home to home, to finally having a home of their own, the two finally decided to take on 
 sharing the love made straight from the comfort of their kitchen into the many hands of others through the craft of sweets and baked goods. 
 That is what makes Butter's Bakery so sweet!
